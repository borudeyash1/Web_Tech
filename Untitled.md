## Features

  

- **Multi-Drone Support:** Simulate and control multiple drones simultaneously, each with a unique color, independent path, and controller.

- **Dynamic Obstacles & No-Fly Zones:** Add obstacles and no-fly zones that move or animate in real time. Drones automatically replan their paths to avoid collisions and restricted areas.

- **Realistic Physics:** Accurate quadrotor dynamics and propeller visuals using PyBullet.

- **Interactive 2D Map:** Drag-and-drop UI for setting start/end points, static and dynamic obstacles, and no-fly zones. Edit the path in real time.

- **Autonomous & Manual Modes:** Switch between full autonomy (A* path following) and manual PID-based control for all drones. Manual mode uses intuitive sliders for thrust, roll, pitch, and yaw.

- **Robust Pathfinding:** A* algorithm ensures drones never cut corners or pass through obstacles/walls. Real-time replanning if the environment changes.

- **Environment Validation:** Clear errors if start/end is inside an obstacle or unreachable.

- **Smooth 3D Animation:** Animated drone movement, propeller visuals, and modern 3D UI.

- **3D Camera Controls:** Rotate, pan, zoom, and follow drones in GUI mode.

- **Mission Logging:** Every move is logged with simulated latitude/longitude and action for each drone.

- **Extensible Architecture:** Modular codebase for easy addition of new features (e.g., mission scripting, swarm behaviors, advanced planners).

- **Beginner-Friendly:** In-map tutorial overlay, clear error messages, and step-by-step guide.

## 3D Simulation Controls

  

- **Switch Mode:** Press `m` to toggle between Autonomous and Manual control for all drones.

- **Manual Control:** Use on-screen sliders to adjust thrust, roll, pitch, and yaw for all drones.

- **Quit:** Press `q` to exit simulation.

  

### 3D Camera Controls (GUI Mode)

- **Rotate:** Left mouse drag

- **Pan:** Right mouse drag

- **Zoom:** Mouse wheel

- **Follow drone:** Press `F`

  

---

  

## Manual Mode

  

- When you press `m`, you enter Manual mode.

- Use the sliders in the "Parameters" window to control:

  - **Thrust:** Up/down movement (0-20 N)

  - **Roll:** Left/right tilt (-0.5 to 0.5 rad)

  - **Pitch:** Forward/backward tilt (-0.5 to 0.5 rad)

  - **Yaw:** Rotation (-0.5 to 0.5 rad)

- The terminal will print which mode you are in and instructions for manual control.

## File & Module Descriptions

  

### src/main.py

- **Entry point for the simulation.** Handles the overall workflow: launches the 2D map UI, collects user input, initializes the simulation, plans paths, and manages the main simulation loop.

  

### src/ui/map_ui.py

- **Interactive 2D map interface.** Lets users set start/end points, add and edit obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and no-fly zones. Handles all mouse interactions and draws the grid, obstacles, and instructions overlay.

  

### src/simulation/simulator.py

- **Core 3D simulation engine.** Manages the PyBullet environment, loads the ground plane, obstacles, and drones, and handles the 3D camera view. Provides methods for stepping the simulation, rendering, and updating the status display.

  

### src/simulation/drone_fleet.py

- **Manages multiple drones.** Keeps track of all drones, their controllers, and their assigned paths. Steps each drone in the simulation and provides access to their states.

  

### src/simulation/quadrotor.py

- **Defines the drone model.** Handles the physical properties, propeller visuals, and application of control inputs (thrust, roll, pitch, yaw) to the drone in the PyBullet world.

  

### src/control/controller.py

- **PID controller logic.** Computes the control inputs (thrust and torques) needed for a drone to reach a target position and velocity, using PID control.

  

### src/planning/path_planner.py

- **Path planning and grid/world conversion.** Implements the A* algorithm for pathfinding, manages the grid representation, and converts between grid and world coordinates. Handles obstacle and no-fly zone integration into planning.

## Customization & Extensibility

  

- **Number of Drones:**

  - Set `num_drones` in `main.py` or pass as an argument to `Simulator`.

- **Drone Colors:**

  - Edit the `drone_colors` list in `simulation/drone_fleet.py` for custom palettes.

- **PID Controller Gains:**

  - Adjust `kp`, `ki`, `kd` in `control/controller.py` or when instantiating `Controller`.

- **Map/Grid Size:**

  - Change `grid_size` and `world_size` in `planning/path_planner.py` for larger or finer maps.

- **Obstacle/Zone Behavior:**

  - Modify velocity vectors in the dynamic obstacles/no-fly zones dictionaries in `main.py`.

- **Simulation Mode:**

  - Use `--gui` for 3D camera controls, or default for headless mode.

- **Logging:**

  - Extend the logging logic in `main.py` to export to CSV/JSON or implement mission replay.

## Troubleshooting

  

- **Drone Not Moving:**

  - Check if the drone is properly initialized with correct mass and inertia

  - Verify control inputs are being applied correctly

  - Ensure the path planning is generating valid paths

  - Check for any collision issues with obstacles

  

- **Black 3D Camera View:**

  - Ensure the camera is positioned above and behind the drone, looking at the scene (see `_get_camera_images` in `simulator.py`).

- **2D Map Not Visible:**

  - Make sure `map_ui.draw()` is called in the simulation loop and `map_ui.close()` is only called at the end.

- **Manual Controls Not Working:**

  - Press `m` to switch to Manual mode. Use the sliders in the "Parameters" window.

- **Simulation Crashes or Lags:**

  - Try reducing the number of drones or obstacles. Ensure your system meets the requirements.
