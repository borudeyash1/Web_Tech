// helper script for api_fetch demo
// This file is intentionally minimal. The main logic lives inline in index.html for the small demo.
// See README.md in this folder for instructions to set your OpenWeatherMap API key and run a local server.

// If you prefer to move the inline script from index.html into this file, let me know and
// I will extract it and wire it up with proper module patterns.
